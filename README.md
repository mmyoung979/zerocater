# ZeroCater Code Submission

## Live Website
[Currently Taken Down]

## Big Picture
I completed the requirements of this assignment in roughly 30 minutes
> including the functionality of checking the availability of a vendor and an extra test case. The rest did take me another couple hours of on-and-off work.

## Obstacles
Since this challenge really only required 10 or so lines of Python code, it was difficult to think of more tests.

## The Extra Mile
1. Building in Django instead of just Python
2. Creating a minimal user interface
3. Deploying on a live URL

## Files To Care About
1. https://github.com/mmyoung979/zerocater/blob/master/restaurants/utils.py
2. https://github.com/mmyoung979/zerocater/blob/master/restaurants/tests.py (python manage.py test)


## Top 3 To Do With More Time
1. Implement PostgreSQL
2. Hide secret keys in environment variables
3. Create more robust UI

## Conclusion
Thank you for considering me.
